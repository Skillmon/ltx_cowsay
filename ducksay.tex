\section{Macros}%>>>
\marginpar{%
  \rlap{%
    \tiny\ducksay[yoda,bubble=\footnotesize,align=t]{Use those, you might}}}
The following macros are available:

\begin{codedescription}
\verb|\ducksay[<options>]{<message>}|\\
  options might include any of the options described in
  section~\ref{sec:options}. Prints an \anml\ saying \msg. \msg\ is not read in
  verbatim. Multi-line \msg s are possible using \verb|\\|. \verb|\\| should not
  be inside a macro but at toplevel. Else use the option \texttt{ht}.

\verb|\duckthink[<options>]{<message>}|\\
  options might include any of the options described in
  section~\ref{sec:options}. Prints an \anml\ thinking \msg. \msg\ is not read
  in verbatim. It is implemented using regular expressions replacing a \verb|\|
  which is only preceded by \verb|\s*| in the first three lines with \verb|O|
  and \verb|o|. It is therefore slower than \verb|\ducksay|. Multi-line \msg s
  are possible using \verb|\\|. \verb|\\| should not be inside a macro but at
  toplevel. Else use the option \texttt{ht}.

\verb|\DefaultAnimal{<animal>}|\\
  use the \anml\ if none is given in the optional argument to \verb|\ducksay| or
  \verb|\duckthink|. Package default is \texttt{duck}. You might specify more
  options than \anml\ with this, but it should contain an \anml, otherwise you
  have to specify an \anml\ in each call of \verb|\ducksay|.

\verb|\AddAnimal(*){<animal>}<ascii-art>|\\
  adds \anml\ to the known animals. \texttt{<ascii-art>} is multi-line verbatim
  and therefore should be delimited either by matching braces or by anything
  that works for \verb|\verb|. If the star is given \anml\ is the new default.
  One space is added to the begin of \anml\ (compensating the opening symbol).
  For example, snowman is added with:\\[1ex]
  \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{verbatim}
\AddAnimal{snowman}
{  \
    \_[_]_
      (")
   >-( : )-<
    (__:__)}
\end{verbatim}
  \end{minipage}
\end{codedescription}

{\reversemarginpar\marginpar{%

  \tiny%
  \ducksay[hedgehog,bubble=\footnotesize,align=t]{Everyone likes\\options}}}
The following Options are available to \verb|\ducksay| and \verb|\duckthink| and
if not otherwise specified also as package options:

\begin{codedescription}
\anml\\
  One of the animals listed in section~\ref{sec:animals} or any of the ones
  added with \verb|\AddAnimal|. Not useable as package option.

\texttt{bubble=\#1}\\
  use \texttt{\#1} in a group right before the bubble (for font switches). Might
  be used as a package option but not all control sequences work out of the box
  here.

\texttt{body=\#1}\\
  use \texttt{\#1} in a group right before the body (meaning the \anml). Might
  be used as a package option but not all control sequences work out of the box
  here). E.g., to right-align the \anml\ to the bubble, use \verb|body=\hfill|.

\texttt{align=\#1}\\
  use \texttt{\#1} as the vertical alignment specifier given to the
  \texttt{tabular} which is around the contents of \verb|\ducksay| and
  \verb|\duckthink|. Might also be used as a package option.

\texttt{msg-align=\#1}\\
  use \texttt{\#1} for alignment of the rows of multi-line \msg s. It should
  match a \texttt{tabular} column specifier. Default is \texttt{l}. It only
  affects the contents of the speech bubble not the bubble.

\texttt{wd=\#1}\\
  in order to detect the width the \msg\ is expanded. This might not work out
  for some commands (e.g. \verb|\url| from \texttt{hyperref}). If you specify
  the width using \texttt{wd} the \msg\ is not expanded and therefore the
  command might work out. \texttt{\#1} should be the character count.

\texttt{ht=\#1}\\
  you might explicitly set the height (the row count) of the \msg. This only has
  an effect if you also specify \texttt{wd}.
\end{codedescription}
  %<<<
\subsection{Package Options}%>>>
The following options are only available as package options during load-time:

\begin{codedescription}
\texttt{animal=\#1}\\
  sets \texttt{\#1} as the default \anml.
\end{codedescription}

\section{Defects}%>>>
{\reversemarginpar\marginpar{%
  \tiny\rlap{\ducksay[frog,bubble=\footnotesize,align=t]{Ohh, no!}}}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item no automatic line wrapping
\end{itemize}
%<<<
\section{Dependencies}%>>>
\marginpar{%
  \tiny\rlap{\ducksay[kangaroo,bubble=\footnotesize,align=t]{We rely on you}}}
The package depends on the two packages \texttt{xparse} and \texttt{l3keys2e}
and all of their dependencies.
